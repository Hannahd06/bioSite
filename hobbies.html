            <h3><em>Find your inner diva</em></h3>
            <p>
                Anthony is a fan of drag stemming from his love and appreciation for RuPaul’s Drag Race. This is a reality television competition hosted by RuPaul that given hopeful Drag Queens the opportunity to be “America’s next drag superstar.” RuPaul has been a huge proponent in bringing drag into mainstream society through his music and growing popularity and interest in the reality show competition.  This sparked his interest in incorporating his love for drag by regularly attending drag shows with friends in his free time. It is a way for people of all backgrounds to just come together and have fun and not take things so seriously. It’s great when the queens engage with the audience, it brings everyone together. While he doesn’t participate in the art of Drag, quoted as saying “I love makeup, but it just isn’t my forte,” being able to experience drag performances in person has been a one-of-a-kind experience.
