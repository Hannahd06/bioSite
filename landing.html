        <h3><em>Stepping up and being a helping hand</em></h3>
        <p>While Anthony's accomplishments may be more personal than official, he would still view them as something to be proud of.  While working at JRI, he was promoted to Manager of the Prevention Services Program. In this position, he was able to hire, supervise and support the growth and development of five full-time staff and ten youth leaders.  He can be quite hard on himself, and set very high expectations for himself, feeling like he was never doing enough to help his team feel successful, and that he could not help them to manage their work stresses. When he left JRI, he was surrounded by so much love and admiration for who he is as a person and the work that he was done. He learned then that you will not always see the “fruits of your labor” and that he truly made an impact. </p>

            <h3><em>Moving towards an inclusive campus experience</em></h3>
            <p>In his transition into his role within higher education, he noticed that there was a lack of diversity and representation of LGBTQ+ experiences on the campus. This inspired him to create programs and events that not only targeted education and awareness for the LGBTQ+ experiences, but that were inclusive across multiple cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Young people get a lot of their information quickly and through social media. Thus, he decided to also focus on promoting student and community engagement for the programs and events and through the use of social media platforms. </p>

            <h3><em>Host with the most</em></h3>
            <p>A professional accomplishment that he is pretty proud of is one during a critical time. Despite the many challenges that came with the COVID-19 pandemic over the past few years, he was able to host the college’s Lavender Graduation for the Class of 2022, in person. The first Lavender Graduation was established in in 1995 by Dr Ronni Sanlo because she was denied opportunity to attend her children’s graduations due to her sexual orientation, celebrating about 3 students that year. Today, there are over 100 campuses that have a Lavender Graduation to honor and celebrate the accomplishments and experiences of LGBTQ+ graduating students. These spaces are important because not all students feel comfortable or supported to live and be their authentic self and these spaces allow these students to be without judgment or fear. </p>
