                Anthony is originally from East Los Angeles California. He obtained his Bachelor’s Degree in Ethnic Studies with a minor in Critical Gender Studies in San Diego, California, followed by a Master’s of Arts in Education, with a focus on Multicultural Counseling. He identifies as a third-generation Chicano, queer cisgender man. He views cultural identity to be an important aspect of his life. His mother and grandmother taught him traditions and values that have allowed him to take pride in his latinidad, whether through food, celebrations, or language. He learned more about the term Chicano during his undergrad at UCSD when he was involved in the student organization: Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano/a de Aztlan (MEChA). In the US, being Chicano was viewed negatively but through El Movimiento in the 1960s, activists reclaimed Chicano, advocated for non-assimilation and pride in culture and values. Being proud of his Mexican heritage is important to him and is empowering for his view on his identity. As a queer man, he reflects on how the term queer was also a derogatory term used against gay people but within the last 20-30 years it has been reclaimed by younger generations as a term of endearment, political and personal empowerment. As he continued to learn about himself and who he loves, he proudly takes ownership and empowerment in his identify as a queer man.

            <p>This has transcended into his passions and his career path. He is passionate about creating spaces, experiences and opportunities for LGBTQ+ youth and young adults to feel that they are worthy and empowered. This drove him to take the biggest risk in 2015, when he made the decision to uproot his life in California and move to Boston for a new professional opportunity, while only knowing one person in Massachusetts. Having to navigate a completely new environment without a close support system was a huge learning curb, but it taught him invaluable lessons that he is grateful for. There he worked for a non-profit program called Boston GLASS, providing a continuum of services to LGBTQ+ youth and young adults of color. He was able to gain experience working with youth, who had very high needs: displacement, food insecurity, substance misuse, sex work, and more. As a program, they could not fulfill every need, so they collaborated with other offices and programs to support youth to help them find more permanent housing, food security, jobs. The direct impact of having security and safety is indescribable; these young people blossomed, they were happy, motivated and excited about life again. “Hard work, but necessary work.” In the last year, he transitioned into higher education where he could continue to do similar work, but now with a different demographic, college students. While the needs are very different, the program aims to provide all students on the campus, and especially LGBTQ+ students of color, to engage in intercultural conversations and experiences, learn skills and advocacy, and provide a safe haven to hopefully have an impactful and influential transition throughout their college experience.  Overall, he strives to be a mentor for LGBTQ+ youth and young adults of color. He hopes to be seen as an inviting and welcoming person and for these youth and young adults to see him as a resource and confidant. He would like to give back to the future generations, just as his mentors did for him. Through his continued work, he hopes to inspire others and help to foster a more understanding society where individuals of all identities can understand and believe that they are heard and that they matter.
